/**
 * One chapter's worth of content in the reader list. RN owns all navigation decisions (which
 * chapters are loaded, when the trio slides forward/back) — this is a dumb rendering unit: the
 * Kotlin/Compose side never decides chapter order or triggers navigation itself, it only draws
 * whatever list of blocks it's given and reports which page is visible via
 * [ReaderPageList]'s onVisiblePageChanged callback.
 *
 * [firstNode]/[lastNode] replace what used to be separate Header/Footer/Gap concepts — Server-
 * Driven UI: RN sends the ENTIRE non-page visual (title text, colors, spacing, and whether a Gap
 * exists at all) as an [SduNode] tree, and Kotlin only interprets it generically ([SduNodeView]).
 * Kotlin never again hardcodes "what a header looks like" — see SduNode.kt doc for the rationale.
 * [firstNode] renders before this chapter's pages (typically a Gap + title), [lastNode] after
 * (typically an end-of-chapter label + next-chapter preview). Either can be null — e.g. the very
 * first chapter of a trio has no Gap-above, the last loaded chapter has no Footer/next-preview if
 * RN hasn't loaded a next neighbor. RN decides ALL of this; Kotlin just draws what's handed to it.

 * But using the bottom edge as the trigger for CHAPTER SWITCHING (this function's chapterId also
 * drives useReader.advanceToNextChapter/retreatToPrevChapter in RN) meant the very first pixel of
 * a neighboring chapter's page touching the bottom edge was enough to switch chapters — reported
 * by the user as switching one page early, not matching the user-specified rule ("switch chapters
 * only once the midline itself has been crossed"). Moving the target line to the midline fixes
 * chapter-switch timing to match that rule; it also means "how many pages read" (baby step 1) now
 * counts a page once its midpoint — not just a sliver of its bottom edge — has passed, which is

 * would make chapterFraction uncomputable — permanently null — until that first full read-through,
 * which is exactly what caused the bar to sit stuck at 0% (confirmed via reader-log-v16.txt:
 * chapterFraction=0.0 on every single line, chapter never reached its Footer).
 *
 * NOTE for future work: this same bottom-of-viewport pixel math (chapter-relative absolute
 * offset ÷ total chapter height) is a natural building block for restoring scroll to the exact
 * pixel the user left off at, not just the top of the page they were on (currently
 * scrollToItem(pageIndex) with no offset — see the `scrollToPageIndex` LaunchedEffect below).
